# The-Planet-Textbased-RPG
This program has been a long term project that I have been working on over the course of the last year or so. I wanted to see how far I could get trying to make a text based RPG in just Python alone with my knoledge of the language. I will probably continue to update it as I make more progress on it. I think that the most stand out part of the game is the first fight sequence with the giant snake and the use of a color library (colorama) for the health and mana bar.
